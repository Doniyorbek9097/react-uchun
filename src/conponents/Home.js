          - a web developer based in Namangan, Uzbekistan. In 2017, after
          <br/>

          graduated from Tashkent University of Information Technologies, I
          started my career as a front-end web developer. Over the last 3 years
          I have been building digital products and helping people bring their
          ideas come to life. I ,as a developer, love coding, learning a new
          technology, reading a book and having a coffee in the morning :).
